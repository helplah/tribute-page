                    <h3>Biography</h3>
                    <p class="lead summary">Elon Musk has stated that the goals of SolarCity, Tesla, and
                        SpaceX revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify biography">Born in South Africa in 1971, Musk moved to Canada in 1989
                        to study in Queen's University. In 1992, he transferred to University of Pennsylvania.
                        In 1995, at age 24, he was about to begin a PhD in applied physics and
                        materials science at Stanford University, but left the program after two days to
                        pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations in the areas of the Internet, renewable energy
                        and outer space. He started Zip2 with his brother and
                         became a millionaire from the sale of it to Compaq.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify biography">In 1999 he co-founded X.com, an online financial services
                        and email payment company. In 2002, PayPal (X.com after merger) was acquired by
                        eBay and Elon received US$165 Million dollars. He then went on to undertake
                        different ventures starting with SpaceX in 2002, Tesla in 2004, SolarCity in 2006,
                        OpenAI in 2015, Neuralink in 2016 and The Boring Company in the same year.</p>

                            merged with Confinity, which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the
                            PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001</li>

                            in May, Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of

                            He started to invest in SolarCity.  The underlying motivation for funding
                            both SolarCity and Tesla is to help combat global warming, and to
                            accelerate the advent of sustainable energy</li>

                            all three of its launches. SpaceX and Tesla were both running out of cash.
                            According to Musk, he says: "We had virtually no money... a fourth failure would have been
                            absolutely game over. Done." In September, the fourth launch succeeds.
                            On Dec. 23, NASA awarded SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to haul at least 20 metric tons of
                            cargo to the international space station over 12 planned flights. Likewise, hours before
                            Tesla would have gone bankrupt - they managed to raise funds</li>
