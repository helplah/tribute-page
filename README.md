# Tribute Page

This website was built as a tribute to Elon Musk, with a short timeline of his life. I chose Elon Musk because I admire and respect his tenacity, work ethics and drive towards serial entrepreneurship. Most importantly, I'm impressed and inspired by his motivation for doing all these things - he truly believes in building a better world. The majority of his net worth was and still is derived from his high-risk high-reward ventures.

This website was built using HTML, SCSS, CSS flexbox and Bootstrap. It is responsive, mobile-friendly and has responsive image. I refactored the code from CSS to SCSS.
